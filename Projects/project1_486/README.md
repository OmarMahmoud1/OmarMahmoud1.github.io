#Topic: Create a timelapse map of earthquake occurances around the world from March 3rd 2020 to March 10, 2020

The sources where I will get the earthquake data will come from the usgs website at: 
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.csv


I will be using ggplot to make static maps with magnitudes plotted and I will use the gganimate package in R Studio to create dynamic maps of where earthquakes have occured and their magnitude. I will be using R Studio and QGIS to create timpelaspe maps of these recent earthqukes.
